There are three levels, each with an exit, The exit should* be pretty intuitive. You have to invert gravity, toggle platforms on and off, and jump on bounce pads to make it to the exit.
- Minor narrative, you crashed your ship (the thing you start off facing) on a wierd planet and are looking for a way to get off the planet.


Features:
The scripts devide the features pretty well, so:
- Toggling the platforms with left and right click
- I got some sound from online + messing with it in Audacity (stretch and distort)
- Inversion of gravity feature. This script is buggy.
- Bounce pads
- I got a couple high quality renders **** from a friend of mine ****, including Clank and a Spaceship, which I threw in the level. You can press e on clank to destory him.
- Added some lights and some particle effects.


Notes:
- The _Resharper folder was autogenerated by a plugin I use. It can be deleted without issue but will be regenerated the next time Resharper runs on visual studio looking at that solution.
- I did involve a friend of mine whos an expert with Miya, he pointed me at a quick way to make cave-like walls and ground which I did myself, but he was _entirely_ responseable for Clank and the Lego ship at the end, but I was primarily concerned with the importing/exporting process.
- I pulled the sounds from free online sound libraries, I distorted some of them in Audacity.
- The space skybox in level 3 is from the web
- I created a boatload of extension methods to help out with programming in hopes I could get to the verbosity and clarity of my application code. Didnt make it. I did get static typing on the MonoBehavior to work out reasonably well though.
